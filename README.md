# Gathering the Art

## Overview
Gathering the Art is a project designed to allow users to find art from the card game Magic the Gathering, by the name of the artist. It was designed to appeal to a niche audience based upon a couple of user personas. 

## Learning Goals
My learning goals for this app were:
* Learn how to create user personas
* Use the user personas to inform the use of data from a public api
* Solidify understanding of using react, and react router to create a multi page app
* Gain a better understanding of how to use Cypress to do end-to-end testing
* Using more atomic commits through the project

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repo onto your machine and cd into it
2. Enter `npm install` into your terminal
3. Run `npm start` to connect to `localhost:3000`
4. Go to `http://localhost:3000/` in the browser to view the site

## App features

* On the main paige, view a list of artists who have made art for Magic the Gathering cards
* Click on an artist and you'll be taken to a page that displays cards with art by that artist
* Click the favorite button to add that card to favorites
* Click the favorite button a second time to remove the card from favorites
* Click on the home button to return home
* Click on the View favorites button to view your favorited cards

## Reflections

I feel like it was good experience trying to think of particular users in terms of user personas when designing an app, and I think it will help with how I design apps in the future. This was also my first time using a public api to pull in data, and that gave me a better sense of what to expect when looking at public api's, how to use them, and understanding how to deal with more data than you will need. I feel like a gained a better understanding of what an atomic commit is, and the workflow required to consistantly make more atomic commits.
